From Micah (Systems Lead):

"I plan on putting all the new ADCS software architecture in this folder. Essentially, the architecture is a finite state machine (FSM) that switches to a new state after the pre-determined state target conditions have been met. I hope to have function(s) from all subteams that are able to recieve requests and act on them. These four main group of functions will ultimately achieve the target conditions of the states and allow the spacecraf to move forward in it's ADCS sequence." 

Let me know if you have any questions! :)
